## Intro

Here I upload my Java exercise.

## Software used

I use [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Extension Pack for Java](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscjava.vscode-java-pack)

As I use only basic Java it's possible to run the exercises easly from the console
